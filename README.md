# Welcome to my first repository.

# First little project
I will constantly update this site with what I will learn to implement what I have learned. 
 *This is the purpose of the site's existence.* ;)
## My Motivation
I am trying to learn HTML, CSS, Bootscrap 4 and Javascript, so this repository is my first worksheet.
I will edit this area later because now I am full-focused to learn something new.
```
 So, see you later!
```
