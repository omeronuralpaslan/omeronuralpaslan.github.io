              <p class="card-text">Hello! My name is Ã–mer Onur.
              I am 22 years old student who trying to learn JavaScript.
              I am studying at Aksaray University in Aksaray, Turkey. 
              My department is Electrical and Electronics Engineering, 
                so I have to learn new things and catch the technology.
              This is the reason of the my interest of JavaScript. 
              I think, we all have to catch the technology because it is improving at the speed of light. 
              Therefore I am full-focused for learning new things and using actively.
              I think, I am on the right way. 
              You can see my biography and more about me at the 'About Me' page.
